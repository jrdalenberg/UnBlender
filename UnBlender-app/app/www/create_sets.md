Select the main cell types that make up your sample and/or cell types that you are interested in.

Some considerations on selecting your combination of cell types:</br>
- You may want to select high resolution (specific) cell type labels for those cell types you’re most interested in (e.g. ‘AT2’ rather than the more generic ‘alveolar epithelium’).

- However, low resolution cell types often yield more accurate results, as they make up a larger proportion of the cells in your sample.
- Selecting cell type categories with distinct gene expression profiles will help your results.
- Sometimes, you may want to merge two or more cell types that have similar gene expression profiles into one category. For example: if the evaluation (step 2) shows that ‘club cells’ </br> and ‘goblet cells’ are not accurately deconvoluted, it may help to select the more generic ‘secretory cells’ instead.
