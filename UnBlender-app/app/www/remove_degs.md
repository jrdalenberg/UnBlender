### Optional: upload a list of disease-associated differentially expressed genes

UnBlender uses healthy reference data to perform cell type deconvolution. This means that if you are using UnBlender to deconvolute <br/>
disease bulk RNA-seq samples, you may want to remove genes from the reference data that are known to be differentially expressed in that <br/>
disease compared to healthy controls.

### Format
Paste your list of disease-associated DEGs in the box below. The format should be as follows: each row contains a separate gene, </br>
identified by the HGNC gene symbols.
